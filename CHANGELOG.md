# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2026.06.09] - 2026-06-09

### Renamed
- **Project rename**: `scout` was previously `scout-tui` / `rWifi`. The Cargo package name, binary name, file paths, registry keys, and docs are now lowercase `scout`. Behavior and features are unchanged.

### Changed
- README rewritten in the new register: WiFi scanner feature list, install matrix, CLI flags, configuration, build instructions, license.
- Drop the legacy "r*" and "Local freedom" branding throughout.
- Drop the per-repo `rApps` umbrella and `build_all.ps1` from this repo; build orchestration lives in [`toolkit`](https://github.com/local76/toolkit).

## [3.1.0] - 2026-06-08

### Changed
- Renamed project back from `scout-tui` to `scout` (crate name: `scout`, binary name: `scout`).
- Split monolithic `src/wlan.rs` (1276 lines) into modular `src/wlan/` files (all under 500 lines).
- Split monolithic `src/main.rs` (2025 lines) into `src/app/`, `src/ui/`, and `src/win32.rs` submodules (all under 500 lines).
- Fixed the selection highlight bug where single mouse clicks on TUI list items or buttons incorrectly triggered full-line selection and clipboard copy.
- Introduced a drag threshold check to prevent mouse clicks from starting text selection unless a drag occurs.
